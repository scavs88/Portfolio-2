                    much to focus on the blogging that I don't do but to see if I am about to set up the body of a
                    paragraph on a page.
                    Hopefully I am right, because if my grade is based on how much blogging I do and, therefore; have
                    material to talk about, I'm screwed.</div>

                    white picket fence yuppy suburban town. It is home to the largest high school system in Michigan
                    PCEP, which consisted of 3 full sized high schools on one campus. As as student I would have classes
                    at all 3, it was set up very much like a college campus.</div>
